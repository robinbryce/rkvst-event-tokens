These contracts have not been audited.

However, much of the code is derived from the following source which has been audited:

* https://github.com/lidofinance/curve-merkle-oracle/blob/main/contracts/MerklePatriciaProofVerifier.sol
* Audit details here https://github.com/lidofinance/curve-merkle-oracle

The primary dependency of that project Solidity-RLP is used here too. And that
has was audited in the same same effort:
